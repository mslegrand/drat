# A drat repository

I needed a better way to distribute some projects of mine and drat appears to great for keeping evolving packages up to date. There are currently only 3 packages here. 

- svgR - a package to generate svg graphics in R
- pointR - a shiny based ide for svgR
- dmdm - a multilevel menubar for shiny. 

pointR is still in flux, hence this makes drat the ideal candiate for distribution.
